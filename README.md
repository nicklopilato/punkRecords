# Punk Records: One Piece Wiki

Welcome to Punk Records, a One Piece Wiki where you can explore information about characters, devil fruits, and organizations in the world of One Piece.

## Overview
***Background:** For our web development class's final project, my partner and I decided to try and tackle a wiki. We chose the theme of One Piece and must give credit to how much inspiration we took from the official wiki. The intent of this project was to develop an acceptable final project whilst having fun implementing an idea we have an interest in. Hence, the closer similarities to the official site will not be claimed as an idea completely thought of on our own. After completing the initial version of the I had a large interest to revisit the project to improve it. The original was a very basic implementation utilizing only HTML, CSS, and JS, without the help of any additional frameworks. This was due to our lack of experience with web development technologies as it was our first time learning it. Now that I have had a lot of further experience working with web development I decided I wanted to update the site and not only improve the implementation but add additional features as well. I will be using Vercel to deploy the site, Contentful to manage the content, Typescript to add type security, and rebuild it using Next/React.*
